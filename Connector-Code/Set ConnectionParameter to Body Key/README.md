This custom code was used to fix a current issue with the Set Property (Preview) Policy Template (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/policy-templates/setproperty/setproperty).
The issue is when the policy is used with a connection parameter (used in this case to have the user enter their API key as the only part of the connection reference) to set a POST request body key to the API key. Since the Set Property policy does not correctly add the API key, a Set Query String Parameter policy was used to include the API key as part of the request, then the custom code moves the query parameter to the request body.
